Macaroni and cheese
ingredients
50g baguette, cut into small chunks
2 tbsp butter, plus 1 tbsp melted
350g spiral or other short pasta
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tsp English mustard powder
3 tbsp plain flour
500ml whole milk
250g vegetarian mature cheddar, grated
50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated
instructions
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spread the baguette chunks over a baking sheet, drizzle with the melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside.

STEP 2
Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack, then drain. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and English mustard powder, cook for 1 min, then stir in the plain flour.

STEP 3
Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a lump-free sauce. Simmer for 5 mins, whisking all the time until thickened. Take off the heat, then stir in the cheddar and half the parmesan.

STEP 4
Stir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce. Tip into a large ovenproof dish, or four individual dishes.

STEP 5
Scatter over the bread and the remaining parmesan, then bake for 20 mins until crisp and golden. Can be frozen before baking â€“ defrost thoroughly before cooking.
